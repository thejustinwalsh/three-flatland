/**
 * Wire protocol between the extension host (`client.ts`) and the sidecar
 * process (`sidecar.ts`) — newline-delimited JSON on stdin (commands) and
 * stdout (responses). Not JSON-RPC/LSP-framed like `@three-flatland/
 * codelens-service` — deliberately simpler, since every message here is a
 * small parameter array or song object, never a large source-file payload
 * that would need byte-precise `Content-Length` framing.
 *
 * Fire-and-forget by design for `play`/`playSong`/`stopSong`/`stop`/
 * `shutdown`: no `id`, no correlation, nothing meaningful to return
 * beyond "it started" (a failure surfaces via `client.onError`). `stats`
 * is the one exception — it exists purely to HAND BACK data (whether
 * real audio is actually reaching the output), so it needs its response
 * observed, not just its ack/nack. `client.ts`'s `getStats()` correlates
 * it by content (the next `cmd: 'stats'` line on stdout) rather than a
 * formal id — safe because the sidecar processes stdin lines strictly
 * sequentially (see `sidecar.ts`'s `rl.on('line', ...)`), so responses
 * are never reordered relative to the commands that produced them.

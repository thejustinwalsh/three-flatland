 * mechanism the built-in Git extension uses to expose its `git.API`. Kept
 * intentionally small: a diagnostic surface for the audio-play sidecar
 * (real AudioContext, no webview panel — see `tools/audio-play/CLAUDE.md`),
 * not a general extensibility API. `getActivePid`/`shutdown`/`getStats`
 * are exactly the functions `playSidecarManager.ts` itself uses —
 * `shutdown` is the same call `context.subscriptions`' dispose handler
 * makes on a real deactivation, not a separate test-only path. `getStats`
 * is the audibility regression guard (see `tools/audio-play/src/player.ts`)
 * — an e2e test drives it to prove a played sound actually reaches the
 * output, not just that `play` acked clean. `ping` is the device-independent
 * counterpart (see `tools/audio-play/CLAUDE.md`'s device-tolerance
 * section): proves the sidecar PROCESS is alive and responding over the
 * wire protocol without touching `AudioContext` at all, so it stays
 * meaningful even on a device-less runner where `getStats`/a real `play`
 * legitimately Nacks.

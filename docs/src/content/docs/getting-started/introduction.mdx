---

import FeatureList from '../../../components/FeatureList.astro';
import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

**three-flatland** is a high-performance 2D sprite and effects library for [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) and [React Three Fiber](https://r3f.docs.pmnd.rs/), using WebGPU and TSL (Three Shader Language).

<Aside type="note" title="Early Alpha">
  three-flatland is in active development. We're exploring performant, maintainable, and extensible patterns for GPU-driven 2D rendering with WebGPU. The API will evolve as we refine these systems. [Follow along on GitHub](https://github.com/thejustinwalsh/three-flatland) — your feedback shapes what we build.
